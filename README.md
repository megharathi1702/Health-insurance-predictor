# Health-insurance-predictor
A machine learning project to predict medical insurance costs based on user input data such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. Built using regression models and Random Forest algorithms.

##🚀 Features
- Predicts individual medical insurance costs based on personal attributes.
- Uses real-world dataset with attributes like age, BMI, smoking habits, etc.
- Achieves ~97% accuracy using Random Forest Regressor (vs. ~74% for basic linear regression).
- Includes detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations.
- Model evaluation using MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and R² Score.

##🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for EDA & visualizations)
- scikit-learn (for model building and evaluation)

##📊 EDA Highlights
- Visualized feature distributions using histograms and box plots.
- Identified correlations using heatmaps.
- Found that **smoking status**, **BMI**, and **age** are major cost-driving features.

## 🧠 Models Used
- Linear Regression (accuracy ~74%)
- Random Forest Regressor (accuracy ~97%)

## 📁 Dataset
- Sourced from [Kaggle]
- Contains 1338 records with 7 features
